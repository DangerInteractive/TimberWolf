# TimberWolf
**a high-performance, cross-platform, modern, pure-rust game engine**

## Objectives
1. seamlessly cross-platform
2. triply safe (type-safe, memory-safe, thread-safe)
3. maximizes performance
4. extensibility and flexibility over ease-of-use

## How to Use
This is a Rust library, available through crates.io. To install as in your
project you simply need to add it to your Cargo.toml as a dependency:
```toml
[dependencies]
timberwolf = "0.3.2"
```

## Running the Demo
As of now, there is only a single demo app, which shows the game loop timing and
logging subsystems.
```bash
cd demo
cargo run
```
